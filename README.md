# BoomBikes Case Study
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.
- In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- we are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- The project is about finding the model which explains about the demand of bikes and use to increase the demand for bike on future
- To find the demand for the bikes
- To manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management 
  to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
Based on the final model we can say top 3 features contributing significantly towards explaining the demand of the shared bikes year, temp and windspeed
-  As year increases the shared bike demand increases at the rate of 0.235 i.e., for a unit increase in the year the bike demand increases by 0.235.
-  As temp increases the shared bike demand increase at the rate of 0.449 i.e., for a unit increase in the temp the bike demand increase by 0.449.
-  As light snow in weather increases the shared bike demand decreases at the rate of 0.286 i.e., for a unit increase in windspeed the bike demand decreases by 0.286
